# Profile Fields Update Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. CV Upload Error (400 Bad Request)
**Problem:** CV was uploading successfully to storage bucket, but the profile update was failing because `cv_url` column didn't exist.

**Solution:** Added `cv_url TEXT` column to profiles table.

### 2. Missing Profile Fields
**Problem:** Profile forms were trying to save fields that didn't exist in the database.

**Solution:** Added all missing fields to both database schema and UI forms.

## How to Apply Changes

### Option 1: Quick Fix (Recommended)
Run `supabase/QUICK-FIX-INDUSTRY.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Adds missing columns and fixes helper function
-- Won't break existing data
```

### Option 2: Full Schema Rebuild
Run `supabase/FINAL-SCHEMA.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Drops and recreates all tables with complete schema
-- Use this for a clean start
```

## Notes

1. **CV Upload**: The CV is stored in Supabase Storage bucket `cvs`, and the file path is saved in `profiles.cv_url`

2. **Field Validation**: All URL fields accept full URLs (https://...). Consider adding client-side validation if needed.

3. **Experience Years**: Stored as INTEGER, accepts numbers only (min: 0)

4. **Bio**: Uses textarea with min-height of 100px for better UX

5. **Skills**: Stored as TEXT[] array, managed through add/remove interface (candidate only)

## Error Handling

All profile update operations now include:
- Try-catch blocks
- Console logging for debugging
- User-friendly error messages
- Loading states with spinners
- Automatic profile reload after successful save
