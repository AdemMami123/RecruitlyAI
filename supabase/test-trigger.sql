-- This is what happens when a user signs up:
-- 1. User is created in auth.users
-- 2. Trigger fires automatically
-- 3. Profile is inserted into public.profiles

-- To test, you can create a test user via Supabase Auth UI
-- Then check if profile was created:

  u.email,
  u.created_at as user_created,
  p.id as profile_id,

FROM auth.users u
LEFT JOIN public.profiles p ON u.id = p.id
ORDER BY u.created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
